The procedure is very common—it is one of the top five \ncosmetic procedures, with more than 213,000 performed in 2018 alone. \nBut despite rhinoplasty's popularity, it is also one of the more complex cosmetic procedures and \ndoesn't always turn out as planned, especially when performed by an inexperienced surgeon or",

The last thing anyone wants is to \nhave revision surgery after a cosmetic procedure, but it beats spending a lifetime with a nose \nthat isn't quite right. \nIf you've already undergone rhinoplasty but are less than satisfied with the results, you may \nwant to consider revision rhinoplasty. Revision rhinoplasty, also called secondary rhinoplasty, is \na surgical procedure that addresses complications or unsatisfactory results following an initial \nnose job. \nWhen Rhinoplasty Goes Wrong: Common Reasons For Revision Although rhinoplasty can \nbe completely transformative, it also carries the risk of being unhappy with the outcome. Studies \nshow that up to 15 percent of rhinoplasty patients end up pursuing revision surgery to correct \nmistakes and improve results. Some of the most common issues that lead to secondary \nrhinoplasty include: \n● Asymmetric nose \n● Nasal airway obstruction \n● Collapsed cartilage or bones \n● Incomplete reshaping \n● Nasal valve collapse \n● Pinched nasal tip \n● Excessive scarring \n● Unnatural appearance \nHow Revision Rhinoplasty Differs From the Initial Procedure Revision rhinoplasty may be \nlonger and more complicated than the initial procedure. Whereas the initial procedure is 1-2 \nhours long, revision rhinoplasty may take double the amount of time to complete successfully \ndue to scar tissue present and previous alterations to the normal anatomy. Scar tissue from the \nfirst rhinoplasty can be problematic during revision surgery and can limit the potential outcome. \nRevision procedures often require the use of cartilage grafts in order to replace damaged \ncartilage from the initial surgery and provide structural support for the nasal tip and/or bridge. In \nmany revision cases, the main objective is to rebuild the tip and bridge using cartilage from the \nseptum, ears, or rib. \nWhen It Makes Sense To Consider Revision Rhinoplasty It may take one to two years for all \nof the swelling and minor asymmetries to subside after the first rhinoplasty procedure. It can \nalso take over a year for scar tissue to soften, and hardened scars can prevent your surgeon \nfrom making corrections. That's why if you're thinking about undergoing secondary rhinoplasty, it \nis important to be patient and allow your nose to fully heal before pursuing a revision. \n\"5 Common Nose Concerns a Rhinoplasty Procedure Solves\" (March 16, 2021) \nFULL CONTENT: For many of our patients, having rhinoplasty, or a \"nose job,\" is a dream come \ntrue.

    "content": "\"5 Common Nose Concerns a Rhinoplasty Procedure Solves\" (March 16, 2021) \nFULL CONTENT: For many of our patients, having rhinoplasty, or a \"nose job,\" is a dream come \ntrue.  A well-performed rhinoplasty procedure can benefit you in multiple ways, from boosting. your self-esteem and improving your overall facial aesthetic, to reducing congestion and \nimproving your breathing. \nWhat Are the Characteristics Of the Ideal Nose? To achieve ideal and classically \"beautiful\" \nresults, our facial plastic surgeons identify and correct concerns to create symmetry, \nproportions, angles, and relationships among features. The ideal face is divided horizontally into \none-thirds, and vertically into one-fifths equal to the width of the nose. \nA nose is considered ideal when it is symmetrical and proportional to a person's overall facial \nfeatures and appearance. In most cases, that's around a 90-95 degree angle for a man and a \n100-115 degree angle for a woman. \n5 Common Nose Concerns a Rhinoplasty Procedure Can Solve: \n1. Overly Large, Wide, Long, or Small Nose - Many people look to rhinoplasty to resize \nand reshape a nose that's too large, wide, long, or even too small for their face. \n2. Nasal Bump or Humps On the Bridge - Nasal bumps and humps on the bridge are a \ncommon concern that many patients seek out rhinoplasty to correct. \n3. An Asymmetric Nose or Uneven Nostrils - Symmetry plays an important role when it \ncomes to our facial features and appearance as a whole. \n4. A Crooked or Misshapen Nose - Many patients pursue rhinoplasty to correct a crooked \nseptum that takes away from their appearance and interferes with breathing and \nfunction. \n5. A Drooping or Pointed Nasal Tip - Rhinoplasty is also commonly sought out to correct \nan unflattering drooping or pointed nasal tip. \nSurgical vs. Liquid Rhinoplasty: Which Is Right For You? Both surgical and liquid \nrhinoplasty have the ability to resize and reshape an overly large or small nose, camouflage \nsmall bumps, improve symmetry, refine the nasal tip, and fill any indentations. \nBODY CONTOURING BLOG POSTS - FULL CONTENT \n\"Tummy Tuck vs. Liposuction: The Skinny Between These Two Procedures\" (September \n12, 2019) \nFULL CONTENT: If it seems like nothing is working to improve the extra cushion in your \nmidsection despite your best efforts, you might find yourself researching popular cosmetic \nsurgical procedures such as tummy tucks or liposuction to address your concerns. Both of these \noptions are highly effective, but they target different areas and ultimately provide different \nresults. \nTummy Tuck vs. Liposuction: What's the Difference?

    "content": "A tummy tuck, also known as \nabdominoplasty, is a surgical procedure designed to smooth and flatten the abdomen area.  \nTummy tucks help to remove excess skin and fat in the lower abdomen, tighten the stomach. muscles, and create a more toned appearing abdomen. A tummy tuck is not a weight loss \nsurgery. \nThe ideal candidate for a tummy tuck is a man or a woman looking to improve the curvature of \ntheir waist, remove loose and excess skin on the abdomen, get rid of their \"pooch,\" and/or have \ntheir abdominal muscles tightened. Pregnancy and weight changes can cause abdominal \nmuscles to separate and skin to appear loose around the stomach. \nLiposuction is a surgical procedure to reshape and contour areas of the body and achieve a \nslimmer physique. Unlike a tummy tuck, which is solely focused on enhancing the abdominal \narea, liposuction can target the abdomen, hips, waist, back, thighs, knees, buttocks, arms, and \nmore. The ideal candidate for liposuction is a healthy patient who has areas of stubborn fat that \nare resistant to diet and exercise. \nThe Benefits of a Combination Approach One of the most popular combos is the \"Mommy \nMakeover,\" which can include tummy tucks, liposuction, breast lifts, and breast augmentation \nprocedures that are performed together. Mommy Makeovers are customizable and can include \na range of different cosmetic procedure combinations. \n\"The 4 Types of Tummy Tucks – Which Technique is Right for You?\" (June 25, 2020) \nFULL CONTENT: Tummy tuck, or abdominoplasty, is a popular cosmetic surgery procedure for \nboth men and women to restore their body and get a smoother, more toned appearance in their \nmidsection. Patients typically seek out this popular body contouring option to address sagging, \nloose skin and muscle weakness that may be a result of weight changes, pregnancy, or the \neffects of aging. \nFour Types of Tummy Tucks: \n1. Conventional Tummy Tuck - A traditional abdominoplasty involves removing an oval- \nor ellipse-shaped wedge of loose skin underneath the belly button to smooth and flatten \nthe area. This technique commonly results in an incision line that runs from hip to hip \nabout an inch or so below the navel. \n2. Mini Tummy Tuck - Some patients are candidates for a \"mini\" tummy tuck procedure to \nremove excess skin and smooth the abdomen. The advantage to this approach is the \nincision line can be shorter and lower, resulting in what we call a \"lingerie scar.\" \n3. Hybrid Abdominoplasty - The most commonly performed abdominoplasty technique at \nour practice is known as a hybrid abdominoplasty. With this technique our Board \nCertified Plastic Surgeon is able to combine the benefits of the conventional and mini \ntummy tuck to achieve optimal results. Instead of making an elliptical incision, our hybrid \nabdominoplasty involves making a pentagon-shaped incision. \n4. Fleur-De-Lis - For patients who have a great deal of horizontal excess skin that extends \naround the abdomen to the back, flanks, and buttocks, the fleur-de-lis may be the best \napproach. The fleur-de-lis adds in the vertical component, allowing our surgeon to \ntighten the sides and back, creating an hourglass shape.",

COMPREHENSIVE PROCEDURE COMBINATIONS BLOG CONTENT \n\"A Perfect Combo: Procedures to Combine for Full Body Contouring\" (May 8, 2025) \nFULL CONTENT: When one procedure can't address all of your personal concerns, combining \ncertain breast and body treatments might be the best solution. Doing this allows you to get the \nexact look you want while reducing surgical costs and recovery time in the process. \nPopular Procedure Combinations: \nBreast Lift + Breast Augmentation - A breast lift procedure helps to lift and reshape the breast \nto address sagginess caused by things like aging and/or weight changes. At the same time, \nbreast augmentation can increase volume in the breast with an implant. This combination is \ncommon for patients who have concerns that their breasts are both too saggy and too small. \nBreast Augmentation + CoolSculpting + CoolTone - While breast augmentation increases \nbreast size with an implant, CoolSculpting and CoolTone help to improve muscle tone and \nreduce fat in targeted areas such as the abdomen, thighs, and buttocks. This is a common \ncombination for young patients who are in good physical shape and have not yet had children. \nTummy Tuck + Liponique - A tummy tuck is an excellent way to remove excess skin and fat \nwhile also tightening the abdominal muscles following pregnancy or weight loss. Additionally, \nLiponique removes fat from selected treatment areas, such as the back, thighs, and arms, when \ncombined with a tummy tuck. \nMommy Makeover Combination - Breast augmentation increases volume in the breast with an \nimplant. Meanwhile, a breast lift helps lift and reshape the breast to address sagginess due to \naging or weight fluctuation. A tummy tuck also removes excess skin and fat and tightens the \nabdominal muscles. This is the most popular combination of procedures for a Mommy \nMakeover. \nSPECIALIZED PROCEDURE BLOG POSTS \n\"Weight Loss After Breast Reduction: How To Lose the Belly Fat\" (April 21, 2025) \nFULL CONTENT: Do you love your body, but wish you had smaller, more proportionate breasts? \nBreast reductions are very popular among our plastic surgery patients, providing a go-to \nsolution for minimizing discomfort caused by large breasts. \nBenefits of Breast Reduction: \n● Improved breast and nipple shape, size, and position \n● More proportionate breasts in relation to your body size \n● Minimized excess fat, tissue, and skin in the breasts \n● Reduced back pain, neck pain, and physical discomfort \n● Decreased skin irritation and bra strap indentations",

I advise my patients that after surgery they will most likely experience \nsome noticeable swelling that will subside within two to six weeks. Patients should know some \nminor swelling can remain for as long as six months, and their lid contours may continue to \nchange. Final results may not be seen until the six month mark.

If you're interested in breast augmentation as part of your mommy makeover, \nwe can even take measurements and give you the opportunity to try on implant sizers in a \nsports bra, giving you an accurate sense of the implant size that will be most appropriate for \nyour goals and physique. \nSurgical Details: Your breast augmentation procedure will be performed alongside an \nanesthesiologist in a fully accredited Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) that exceeds the most \nstringent state and national accreditation standards, providing you with the highest level of \nsafety available. \nBreast Lift (Mastopexy) - Complete Information \nOverview: A breast lift—also known as a mastopexy—is a surgical procedure that raises and \nreshapes sagging breasts with your own tissue, improving your silhouette and giving you the \nability to change the shape and location of your nipples. \nKey Differences: The difference between a breast lift and breast augmentation is that an \naugmentation focuses on volume and projection, while a breast lift focuses on eliminating \nsagging skin and breast tissue. This creates a firmer, more youthful appearance without \nchanging the size or projection of your breasts. \nSurgical Process: Your procedure will remove any excess that may be present, placing the \nnipple higher up on your breast to create a more pert appearance. Sutures may be placed in the \ndeeper tissues to offer you increased support. Many women are interested in combining breast \nlift surgery with breast augmentation to both lift and increase the size and projection of their \nbreasts. \nRecovery: You'll be able to return home the same day as your breast lift surgery, though you'll \nneed a friend to drive you home as your anesthesia wears off. We'll support your breasts and \ntissues with a wrap following surgery, and your enhanced breast shape will become more and \nmore visible as post-surgery swelling subsides over the following few weeks. We recommend \nrecovering at home for about four days before resuming your everyday activities. \nBreast Implant Exchange - Detailed Process \nOverview: The quality of breast implants has improved dramatically over the last fifteen years, \nwith surgical procedures and practices now offering women better results than ever before. \nSome women want to improve upon an earlier augmentation (often known as a breast implant \nrevision), while others see the more natural results of modern implants and want their breasts to \nlook and feel the same.",

Reasons for Exchange: \n● Improvement upon earlier augmentation \n● Desire for more natural-looking results with modern implants \n● Size increase or decrease \n● Change from saline to silicone gel implants \n● Addressing complications or changes in aesthetic preferences \nCandidacy Considerations: When deciding whether you should have another breast \naugmentation procedure, you should consider: \n● When was your last augmentation? \n● Why did you have the first augmentation? \n● Do you really want to go bigger? \n● Have your aesthetic goals changed? \nSurgical Details: The surgery for breast re-augmentation is similar to the original procedure, \nalthough the exact nature may be different depending on the type of breast implant being \nplaced. Patients are placed in an elastic compression wrap once dressings and drainage tubes \nhave been placed at the end of the breast implant re-do. \nRecovery: Breast implant exchange is an outpatient procedure, and patients can typically \nreturn home on the same day as the surgery. Swelling and bruising are common for this \nprocedure, and while some patients will see this subside in a few days, it may take months for \nothers. Individuals can return to work within a few days if their job does not involve heavy lifting \nor pushing. \nBreast Implant Removal - Complete Information \nOverview: Just as breast augmentation may have been a great fit for you at one point in your \nlife, breast implant removal can help you change your appearance to better suit your current \nstage. Breast augmentation is reversible and gives patients the flexibility needed to remove \nbreast implants or opt for breast reaugmentation. \nReasons for Removal: \n● Body reaction to implants causing texture changes \n● Capsular contraction and calcification causing discomfort \n● Changed aesthetic ideals \n● Preference for more comfortable, practical breast size \n● Back pain from larger implants \n● Lifestyle changes \nRecovery Process: For basic implant removal, you can immediately resume your daily routine \nand even return to work the next day.

If a breast lift is performed at the same time as your. implant removal, then your recovery period will be slightly longer. For all procedures, we \nrecommend avoiding heavy lifting and physical exercise for at least six weeks. \nImportant Considerations: Though it is possible that the removal of breast implants can leave \nthe breasts looking saggy and empty, our board-certified plastic surgeons are experts with \nbreast and body procedures. You'll work together with your surgeon to design a treatment plan \nthat avoids this scenario. \nSPECIALIZED BREAST COMPLICATIONS & SOLUTIONS \n\"Understanding and Correcting the Double Bubble Issue with Breast Implants\" (May 14, \n2025) \nFULL CONTENT: Breast augmentation is a popular cosmetic procedure, offering countless \nwomen the opportunity to enhance their appearance and boost their confidence. While the vast \nmajority of these surgeries are successful and result in high patient satisfaction, complications \ncan occasionally arise. One such complication is the \"double bubble\" deformity. \nWhat is Double Bubble? The term \"double bubble\" refers to a specific type of breast implant \nmalposition where a visible crease or indentation forms beneath the breast. This creates the \nappearance of two distinct bulges or \"bubbles\" – the natural breast tissue and the implant. \nCauses of Double Bubble: \n● Submuscular Placement: Implants placed beneath the chest muscle can sometimes \nshift or cause the lower part of the breast to drop, especially if the natural breast tissue is \nalready slightly droopy (ptotic) \n● Incorrect Pocket Creation: During surgery, the creation of the pocket where the implant \nsits is crucial. If the pocket is not created properly, it can lead to malposition \n● Natural Breast Characteristics: Women with significant natural breast tissue, \nespecially if it sags, are at a higher risk of developing a double bubble \n● Healing and Scarring: Post-surgical healing and scar tissue formation can sometimes \nalter the placement of the implant \n● Weight Fluctuations: Significant changes in weight can affect breast tissue and implant \npositioning \nIdentification: The double bubble deformity is typically noticeable when looking at the breast in \nprofile or when raising the arms. There will be a visible indentation or fold across the lower \nportion of the breast, separating the natural tissue from the implant. This issue can affect one or \nboth breasts and can vary in severity. \nCorrection Methods: \n● Repositioning the Implant: One of the most common corrective measures involves \nrepositioning the implant. This might include adjusting the pocket where the implant sits, \neither by lowering the inframammary fold or moving the implant",

Patients often report a significant improvement in their breast \nappearance and a boost in self-confidence following revision surgery. \nMOMMY MAKEOVER - COMPREHENSIVE DETAILS \nComplete Mommy Makeover Information \nOverview: Pregnancy can be hard on a woman's body: The muscles and tissues expand to \naccommodate the baby, especially in the abdomen, hips, and breasts.

Breast Augmentation: This procedure increases breast size by placing an implant \nbeneath the breast tissue or chest muscles. \n4. Breast Lift: This procedure removes excess tissue and reshapes breasts for a lifted, \nperky appearance. \n5. Breast Reduction: Reduce your breast size for a more balanced look or to alleviate \ndiscomfort. \n6.

Designed by our founder and medical director, Facial Plastic Surgeon Ross A. \nClevens, MD, FACS, this procedure addresses a number of the most common signs of aging, \nsuch as sagging skin beneath the chin (sometimes known as a \"turkey neck\"), loss of volume, \nand visible muscle banding in the neck, chin, and jawline. \nBackground: According to the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, 73 percent of those \nexploring cosmetic procedures are concerned with excess fat under the chin and neck. As we \nget older, three signs of aging occur in the neck: skin loses elasticity and becomes lax, \nunwanted fat accumulates, and the platysma muscles (located under the chin and down the \nneck) weaken and separate. \nIdeal Candidates: The Signature Profile Neck Lift™ is an ideal solution for anyone who has: \n● Significant laxity in the neck and chin \n● Muscle banding \n● Unwanted fat deposits \n● Excess sagging skin \n● Interest in a facelift without the required downtime \n● Too much excess tissue in the neck to enjoy the benefits of the Laser-Assisted Weekend \nNeck Lift™ \nCandidacy Requirements: \n● Nearly anyone in good overall health who wants a more youthful neckline \n● Both men and women in multiple age groups (it's one of the procedures most highly \nsought after by men!) \n● People who have lost a significant amount of weight to remove resulting excess skin \n● Within 20 pounds of ideal weight (recommended) \n● Those with health risks that prevent pursuing a facelift \nSurgical Procedure: The Signature Profile Neck Lift is performed in our office under local \nanesthesia.

The incision will be customized according to your unique anatomy, \nso it will be well camouflaged and difficult to see after the healing process is complete. \nBenefits: \n● Significant improvement in the contour of the neck and chin \n● Tightening of the lax muscles that often form bands on the neckline \n● Can be safely and comfortably performed in the office under local anesthesia \n● Requires only a very small incision that is well hidden and fades over time \n● Addresses common issues like turkey neck and muscle banding \n● Same benefits as a facelift but with less downtime and lower cost \nRecovery: One of the biggest benefits to the Profile Neck Lift™ is how simple the recovery \nprocess is following the procedure. Many patients only experience minimal bruising, fullness, \nand discomfort. After a Signature Profile Neck Lift™, it's important to restrict normal activities \nand get more rest than usual to speed up your recovery. You should avoid aspirin, ibuprofen, \nVitamin E, and any medicines that thin the blood for 10-14 days prior to and subsequent to your \nneck lift surgery. \nCombination Options: The Profile Neck Lift™ is minimally invasive and can be safely \ncombined with other procedures to achieve ideal results. It's often combined with other facial \nand eyelid rejuvenative procedures, such as upper and/or lower eyelid blepharoplasty, and \ndermal fillers, like Botox. \nPatient Testimonials: \"I am very pleased with the results from my procedure. I am happy that I \nhave had the excess skin removed from my neck. I hated the skin that hung from my neck. I \ncalled the excess skin my chicken neck, and after 15 years I finally had the procedure to fix it. I \nwish I had done it sooner.\" -B.C. \n\"I recently lost 100 pounds and feel better than ever!

Dr. Clevens will always work to methodically \ncamouflage the incision based on your anatomy. Excess fat and skin laxity will be addressed \naccording to your personal goals, while loose neck muscles are tightened to reduce banding. \nDissolvable sutures will then be placed to carefully close your incisions. \nRecovery Information: Neck lift recovery depends on the type of neck lift performed, how \nmuch fat and skin were removed, and if other procedures were performed during the neck lift. \nYour neck may feel tight and appear bruised immediately following your surgery. After a neck lift \nprocedure, you will return home the same day as your surgery and will want to rest and take it \neasy.

SURGICAL VS. LIQUID RHINOPLASTY - COMPLETE COMPARISON \n\"Surgical vs. Liquid Rhinoplasty: Which Nose Job is Right for You?\" (March 29, 2025) - \nFull Content: \nWhat's more, advancing technologies are creating more options than ever before for improving \nyour nose. Just because you want to enhance your nose doesn't necessarily mean you need to \nundergo surgery. There are now non-surgical options available to help improve the appearance \nof your nose. \nSurgical Rhinoplasty Details: \n● Definition: Rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves \nmanipulating the skin, bone, and cartilage of the nose to reshape, refine, and resize it \n● Reasons for choosing: Correcting an overly large or small nose, fixing crooked or \nuneven nostrils, functional improvements \n● Benefits: Only long-lasting fix, completely customizable, allows you to reshape nose \nuntil it's exactly what you want, permanent results \n● Drawbacks: Longer recovery time, still surgery with potential risks, permanent results \n(can't be easily undone) \n● Recovery: 7-10 day recovery period required \nLiquid Rhinoplasty Details: \n● Definition: Nonsurgical rhinoplasty is a cosmetic treatment that involves using injectable \nfillers to reshape the nose without the need for any incisions \n● Benefits: Quick, nonsurgical nose job with no downtime, patients can resume daily \nactivities right away, typically no bruising or fullness afterwards, instant results, \ncost-effective \n● Drawbacks: Results are temporary (typically last up to two years), not everyone is \nqualified candidate, doesn't reduce nose size, requires skilled injector for desirable \noutcomes \n● Best for: Patients looking for permanent change may want to explore surgical \nrhinoplasty, but liquid rhinoplasty is cost-effective way to see how you feel about results \nbefore having surgery \nDecision Factors: \n● Functional vs. Cosmetic: Patients with more functional rather than cosmetic concerns \nsuch as sleep apnea, severe congestion, trouble breathing, and/or a deviated septum \nare likely better candidates for surgical rhinoplasty \n● Candidacy: Not everyone is a candidate for liquid rhinoplasty, because only certain \nconcerns can be addressed nonsurgically \n● Long-term goals: It all depends on you and your goals!",

    "content": "Surgical Rhinoplasty Details: \n● Definition: Rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves \nmanipulating the skin, bone, and cartilage of the nose to reshape, refine, and resize it \n● Reasons for choosing: Correcting an overly large or small nose, fixing crooked or \nuneven nostrils, functional improvements \n● Benefits: Only long-lasting fix, completely customizable, allows you to reshape nose \nuntil it's exactly what you want, permanent results \n● Drawbacks: Longer recovery time, still surgery with potential risks, permanent results \n(can't be easily undone) \n● Recovery: 7-10 day recovery period required \nLiquid Rhinoplasty Details: \n● Definition: Nonsurgical rhinoplasty is a cosmetic treatment that involves using injectable \nfillers to reshape the nose without the need for any incisions \n● Benefits: Quick, nonsurgical nose job with no downtime, patients can resume daily \nactivities right away, typically no bruising or fullness afterwards, instant results, \ncost-effective \n● Drawbacks: Results are temporary (typically last up to two years), not everyone is \nqualified candidate, doesn't reduce nose size, requires skilled injector for desirable \noutcomes \n● Best for: Patients looking for permanent change may want to explore surgical \nrhinoplasty, but liquid rhinoplasty is cost-effective way to see how you feel about results \nbefore having surgery \nDecision Factors: \n● Functional vs.  Cosmetic: Patients with more functional rather than cosmetic concerns \nsuch as sleep apnea, severe congestion, trouble breathing, and/or a deviated septum \nare likely better candidates for surgical rhinoplasty \n● Candidacy: Not everyone is a candidate for liquid rhinoplasty, because only certain \nconcerns can be addressed nonsurgically \n● Long-term goals: It all depends on you and your goals. SURGICAL RHINOPLASTY - COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION \nComplete Surgical Rhinoplasty Details: \nOverview: We perform rhinoplasty procedures in Melbourne and Merritt Island, FL to help \npermanently reshape your nose, improve breathing, and reduce congestion. Rhinoplasty, also \nknown as a nose job, improves the size and proportion of your nose. In addition to correcting \naesthetic concerns about the bridge of your nose (a nasal hump or indentation), the projection \nof the tip, or a crooked nose, the procedure can also improve breathing and reduce congestion. \nConsultation Process: You will experience a one-on-one consultation with Dr. Clevens or Dr. \nBarbee, who will take the time to fully explore your procedure and answer any questions you \nmay have. Together, you will work on designing a custom procedure that meets your needs, \nwhile your surgeon also takes care to answer all of your concerns so you feel comfortable and \nknow what to expect. \nTreatment Planning: Consultations are also an ideal opportunity to discuss other plastic \nsurgery options that concern your facial features. Once your treatment plan has been agreed \nupon, we'll present you with a quote for your surgery and talk over any financing options that \nmay interest you. Finally, we'll schedule your surgery, along with any related pre- and \npost-operative appointments. \nSurgical Techniques: \n● Open Rhinoplasty: Incisions made externally between the nostrils \n● Closed Rhinoplasty: Incisions made internally concealed within the nose \n● Technique Selection: The chosen technique depends on your needs, and your surgeon \nwill talk you through the ins and outs of your procedure before getting started \nSurgical Process: \n1. Anesthesia or sedation administered for comfort and safety \n2. Incisions made (open or closed technique) \n3. Nasal bones often carved, reshaped, or reset, depending on goals for surgery \n4. Cartilage manipulation and reshaping \n5. Careful closure of incisions \nSafety Measures: Since rhinoplasty is typically an elective procedure, it is only performed \nunder the safest conditions. To ensure your safety and comfort, Dr. Clevens and Dr. Barbee \nbring their patients to a fully accredited ambulatory surgery center with physician \nanesthesiologists. \nAdvanced Techniques: The facial plastic surgeons at Clevens Face and Body Specialists use \nnatural healing serums and TXA (tranexamic acid) during rhinoplasty and other procedures so \nmany patients experience no bruising at all.",

Recovery Timeline: \n● Immediate: Apply ice compresses for first 48 hours to manage swelling \n● Week 1: Dressing removed, notice significant changes to overall nose shape \n● Week 2: Fullness should have diminished enough to notice changes in nasal structure \n● Ongoing: Initial swelling should subside quickly and continue to decline for several \nmonths \n● Activity Restrictions: Contact sports, diving, and other strenuous activities should be \navoided for first 3-4 months \nCommon Concerns Addressed: \n● Glasses: Can place pressure on nasal bridge and typically not worn during initial \nrecovery period. Dr. Clevens will help find alternatives for vision correction during this \ntime. \n● Breathing: It's normal to feel congested after rhinoplasty, but nasal passages will be \nfragile initially \nPOST-RHINOPLASTY CARE - DETAILED GUIDANCE \n\"Six Things to Avoid After Rhinoplasty\" - Complete Content: \nThe recovery period after any type of facial plastic surgery is as important as the preparation \nperiod and as important as what goes on during the actual surgery itself. After rhinoplasty, what \nyou do (or don't do) to your nose affects your results as much as what you tell the surgeon you'd \nlike changed about your original nose. \n1. Exercise and Strenuous Activity: It's common for surgeons to recommend avoiding \nexercise and other strenuous activity for about a month after rhinoplasty. But even some \nseemingly benign forms of movement should also be avoided during those first weeks after \nsurgery, such as: \n● Bending over or leaning forward \n● Lifting anything remotely heavy \n● Stretching the facial muscles \n● After surgery, keeping the head elevated is usually recommended \n2. Nose Piercings: Surgeons recommend avoiding the use of any nose piercing during the next \nthree months after performing nose surgery, and you will need to pay attention to ensure proper \nhealing. Most piercing shops will give you a detailed report or suggest recommendations for \npiercing care, but be sure to ask all questions to your plastic surgeon. \n3. Swimming: Swimming, or even just splashing about in the pool, should be avoided until your \nsurgeon gives you the go-ahead, usually two months or so after your rhinoplasty. Swimming \nisn't just a form of exercise—it also exposes your healing nose to chlorinated or salty water,",

Swimming \nisn't just a form of exercise—it also exposes your healing nose to chlorinated or salty water,. which can irritate the healing incisions or the delicate nasal passages. Swimming can also put \npressure on the nose, potentially impacting the results from your surgery. \n4. Blowing Your Nose: It's normal to feel a bit congested after your rhinoplasty. But since the \nnasal passages are going to be a bit fragile, you want to resist the urge to blow your nose during \nthat time. Blowing your nose with any force can make it bleed, particularly during the first week \nafter surgery. You'll also want to resist the urge to sniff through your nose in the first few weeks \nafter your rhinoplasty. \n5. Sneezing: Many surgeons advise avoiding sneezing for at least the first week or so after your \nsurgery. If you feel a sneeze coming on, try opening your mouth, to reduce the force on your \nnose. Coping with sneezing and feelings of congestion can be challenging after your recovery, \nbut just remember that any discomfort is temporary. \n6. Activities that Risk Impact: Any activities that could result in impact to the nose should be \navoided during the healing period. \nPATIENT TESTIMONIALS & STORIES \n● Complete video testimonial collection including specific procedure experiences \n● Detailed patient journey stories for rhinoplasty, facial procedures, breast procedures, and \nbody contouring \n● Extensive before and after photo galleries with detailed case studies showing \ntransformation results \n● Real patient experiences with specific treatment protocols and recovery outcomes \n● Patient feedback on signature procedures like Clevens Instant Liquid Rhinoplasty and \nProfile Neck Lift™ \nMEDICAL AESTHETICS & SKINCARE - COMPREHENSIVE SHOP \nINFORMATION \nMedical-Grade Skincare Line - Complete Details: \nCreator & Formulation: Formulated by Harvard-trained Facial Plastic Surgeon Ross A. \nClevens, MD, FACS, our medical-grade skincare collection is designed with higher \nconcentrations of active ingredients to deliver results that over-the-counter products just can't \nachieve. \nProduct Categories: \n● Anti-aging treatments \n● Acne care solutions \n● Redness and rosacea treatments \n● Professional-grade skincare regimens",
